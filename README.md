# node-red-contrib-chatbot

## Available nodes
* *Message*: sends a text message from the chat bot, supports templating (variable like /{{firstName}}/, etc), tracking of response and quoting a previous comment
* *Waiting*: sets the waiting status on the chat client (something like _your_chatbot is typing_ )
* *Command*: listen to a command type message (for example `/command1`, `/my-command`, etc)
* *Image*: takes the `msg.payload` binary and sends out as image to the chat (for example connected to a http node or file node), can track response
